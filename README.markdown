Unraverl
========

As you can see unraverl is brand new, it doesn't even have a make file (should I start using rake with my erlang projects? Thats what the cool kids seem to be doing).

You can check out what it does, and why I hacked it here: http://nickelcode.com/2009/03/30/unraverl-filters-and-more-for-erlang/

Once I get some tests in place and make it into a proper project, I'll have more info here, and a page on my site. Enjoy!
